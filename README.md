# Programming Methods (Programmeermethoden)
This repository contains four projects I have written during my first ten weeks
of learning C++ as assignments for the Dutch-taught course 
'Programming Methods'. Due to the academic nature of these projects, there were
some rules we had to abide by, such as what we should and should not check for 
regarding user-input and which header files and (member) functions we were 
allowed to use.

The assignments that are placed within this repository are exact copies of the 
assignments I handed in, however they are stripped of any personal, identifying 
information.

As assignments one and two were primarily based around teaching us how to 
properly make use of functions, streams, variables and more for later use in
assignments three and four, I decided on only translating the latter two to 
English, as this saved me a lot of time and effort. It might also help Dutch 
reviewers interested in my code to take a look, without the need of 
understanding the English language properly.

I am open to any questions, feedback or suggestions related to this and my 
other projects. Therefore, feel free to reach out to me.
## Assignment 1 (Date: 23/09/2021, Grade: 8/10)
For this assignment, we had to code a command-line based application program for
my university. It does various age-related checks and asks some related 
questions.
It then asks either a mathematical or historical question and bases its decision
of approval or dismissal on whether the end-user answered those correctly.

## Assignment 2 (Date: 16/10/2021, Grade: 9.5/10)
For this assignment, we had to convert an input code file while doing various 
steps a compiler would also do, e.g. removing commentation, fixing indentation, 
et cetera. It was our first time making use of self-written functions and 
working with file i/o.

## Assignment 3 (date: 16/11/2021, Grade: 6.5/10)
For this assignment, we had to code a visual representation of Conway's 'Game of
Life' by making use of the command-line. It was our first time using arrays and 
OOP-related principles.

## Assignment 4 (Date: unknown, Grade ?/10)
Coffeesweeper (minesweeper but with coffee cups)

To be placed.
